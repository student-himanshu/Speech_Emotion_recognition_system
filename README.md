# Speech Emotion Recognition System 🎤😊

This project is a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system** that can detect human emotions from speech input.  
It uses **machine learning & deep learning techniques** to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Recognizes emotions from **speech input** in real-time.  
- Uses **audio preprocessing** (MFCC, spectrograms, etc.).  
- Built using **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Librosa, OpenCV**.  
- Supports both **live audio** and **live video** emotion recognition.  
- Visualizes detected emotions for better understanding.
